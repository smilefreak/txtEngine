      Looking around you don't recognise anything, no one is around.
      There are many things in this room, your head is spinning but you manage to put the pieces together.
      You are in a growers room, many rare species of plant surround you. Its strange, the plants don't have any smell, in fact there is no smell at all around you. There seems to be a small stream of water ever so slowly, but surely, flowing around the plants in a never ending loop. A design unimaginable to you. 
      The only exit you can see is a ladder leading to a trapdoor, in what you
      can only guess is the north end of the room.

It is tow metal doors meeting in the middle with an litlle light above them. The shed has a few bits and pieces, most notable there are many bags of potting mix, most empty, and garnng tools. This explains the room below. But why did the plants have unusual smells, and why were they unrecognisable? As you ponder this thought you see the sheds door is wide open to the world outside.
