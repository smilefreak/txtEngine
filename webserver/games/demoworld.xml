      The alarm sound is piercing but unphased you continue to empty
      the valuables from inside the bank's vault into a bag in
      front of you... As sweat collects underneath the balaclava your
      mum knitted you the realisation sinks in that you are a loser
      and you live with your mum. Robbing the bank may impress a lot
      of people... but for fucks sake, find your way out now or you'll
      be living in prison! Don't forget to get your gun and bag...
      Exit to the north.
