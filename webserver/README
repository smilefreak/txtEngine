txtEngine External API

The textEngine API is a unique addition to the txtEngine family. The API is especially designed to externalize the GUI/CLI mechanisms so that custom implementations can be created. An example program is provided showing how one can fully utilize the API.

To call the API provide the following parameters to the executable:
.txtEngine -exec [game-file] [save-file] [command]

The executable will provide output to stdout in the following format:
The output is in provided in JSON format.

{
    "response": "string",
    "inventory": ["string", "string", â€¦],
    "areaname": "string",
    "areadescription": "string"
}

To use the example application, place a compiled copy of the app in the root directory of the web folder. The "webserver" directory requires complete placement into a server environment, for this requirement an apache server with php5 support will suffice.

NOTE: The server only works where support for:
- shellexec command under PHP is available
- save folder is read/writeable
- games folder is readable

=========

A precompiled binary for OSX is provided in the root directory of the web server for convenience purposes.

Instructions for OSX:
- Copy webserver folder to ~/Sites
- Enable "Web Sharing" under System Preferences->Sharing
- Open web browser to "http://localhost/webserver"
