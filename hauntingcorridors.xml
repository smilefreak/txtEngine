      You come to in a sullen chamber with dim light overhead. You cannot remember how you got here but the stench of death
      fills your nostrils, you begin to dry reach. "Get a hold of yourself lawrence," you say. There must be an explanation.
      Things like this don't happen to good people. Especially not the founder of non for profit industries the world's largest
      grossing charity. From starving African babies, to abortion clinics, to drug help and so on. Time to escape, Time to move
      as you grow the courage to explore the chamber, you hear faint screams from a distance.

      You scan the dimly lit room and you eye a collapsed wall to the east that is small enough for you to crawl through.
      To the north is a archway with a nice looking cobblestone path it looks much safer than the east.
      To the west a studded metal door is swung ajar, you can enter through the door but you are weary of the entrance as you can
      hear the roar of a fire in the distance.

        In the center of the room on top of a shoulder height podium, a torch glows so brightly you imagine that it has been
        glowing for thousands of years.Then you realize that thought is ridiculous. The intricate design on the hold suggest that many hours have been spent crafting this lamp.
        The torch looks like it would fit nicely in your hand

      As you scan your torch from left to right you realise you're in the middle of a huge exogorth nest. Those smelly exogorths sure have been
      busy digging! Its ok though, the nest is abandoned, phew! But what a state! There's faecal matter everywhere! You better get the heck out
      of here before you catch a nasty case of pink eye.

      There are exits through a tunnel to the south, to the east, and to the west.

      Its a big room with a raging furnace in the centre. This is probably how they heat the place. The stench and heat is overwhelming.
      It is time to move on.

     There is a door to the north, the east, and the west. Hmmm, which one to pick?
