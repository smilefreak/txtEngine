      The alarm sound is piercing but unphased you continue to empty the valuables from inside the City Bank's vault into a bag in front of you... As sweat collects underneath the balaclava your mum knitted you the realisation sinks in that it is time to get your bag and gun and make for the nearest exit before the police show up.

      You are a loser and you live with your mum. Robbing the bank may impress a lot of people... but for fucks sake, find your way out now or you'll be living in prison! Don't forget to get your gun and bag...

      People are huddled face down. There's fewer customers than you thought but then again it is a Westpac bank. Your partner in crime is watching over keeping control of the situation. "Lets go Terrance!", he yells from his wheelchair, pistol waving madly. Robert certainly is one crazy SOB.

      Fresh air slaps you in the face and you breath in the sweet smell of freedom and money, oh and the stacks of Street Cred you're gaining. It smells good! Slight problem though - the security guard is coming at you with *SURPRISE* an axe. You had better shoot him in the face!

      The van is ready and waiting with wheelchair ramp down. Seconds seem like hours as the ramp pulls Robert inside the van. The jobs not done yet, you lock the wheels on Roberts wheelchair and make sure he is secure. Safety is paramount.
